Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for New Students
## Description
This project is the first step to become a developer and help me get into the mindset of a developer.
This is a practice space and a hub to host some notes on how I developed this application.
I learned a lot about JavaScript and CSS through the creative process.
## Installation
N/A
## Useage
Each section has notes about the different languages that were used in the process of making the application. 
These notes I refrenced a lot throughout the creation to help me better navigate without following the tutorial step by step, so I was able to learn more.
